# DigitClassifier
A neural network with three hidden layers, and a self-implemented back propagation, to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST database with ~94% accuracy, and a best of 95% accuracy.

# Getting Started
- Download the binary files of the test data from the MNIST database
- Run ```python mnistToText.py``` on both the training set and validation set to convert both files into text files.
- Run ```python app.py``` to train the neural network on the training set, and then test its accuracy on the validation set.
